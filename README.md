# matlab-regression
In this repo, I've created a some functions on matlab/gnu octave, to solve a linear regression problems. Gradient descent used to find the correct theta by minimizing the cost function over time for every iteration. Meanwhile, the normal equation performs some matrix calculations, such as transform and multiply, to solve linear regression problems analytically. Even though, the example I provided in this repo is only one-featured data, you can also take and use the code for solving multi-variate linear regression problem.
